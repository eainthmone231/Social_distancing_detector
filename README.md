## Description

Detecting people that violate social distancing rule.It use Yolov3 trained on coco dataset.

This social distancing detector did not leverage a proper camera calibration, meaning that we could not (easily) map distances in pixels to actual measurable units (i.e., meters, feet, etc.).
